### Francesco Pinto, Eugenio Baldo, Simone Chieppa, Alessio Galimi

#### Project for Statistical Learning course - AY 2021/2022

The aim of this project is to classify correctly artworks belonging to different art movements by using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.


The project has been developed in the following main phases: \
• Data collection \
• Feature extraction \
• Exploratory data analysis \
• Models definition, implementation and evaluation \
• Performance comparison
